Since then we've been \ncollecting wild plants to make \nmedicine without knowing its \neffect.  Nevertheless, they \nwere used in healing the \nwounds of the soldiers. \nAnd all we could do was to {clear}wait for the rescue.{clear}Why haven't they come to \nrescue us?  I've thought \nabout the question for \nthe past ten years and \nI have come to a conclusion. \nThe Time shift or fold \nis caused by the {0x0008}Overdrive{0x0009} \nof the 3rd Energy.  But our \ncurrent technology level \nwasn't high enough to {clear}recover the {0x0008}accident{0x0009}. \nYears of technology research \nstill would not be enough.{clear}A time error of 10 or 20 \nyears is insignificant to \na time slip of 65 million \nyears.  But that error, \nthat time difference could \nmean everything for us. \nWe should have never laid \nour hands on a toy so \ndangerous.</Text>

    <Text>March 25th \nLately many of our guys have \nreported missing belongings. \nEspecially smaller items such \nas hand mirrors and watches. \nJust the other day, my \nsilver rocket followed the \nsame fate.

Come to think of \nit all of the missing items \nwere all shiny things.{clear}They seem to have a lot of \nsimilarities with the birds. \nIt could be that they are \ntheir ancestors.

But if we use \ntheir behavior to our \nadvantage, then maybe...{clear}April 6th \nWe used the cage used for \nlaboratory animals and we \nwere finally able to capture \none of them.  We used \nAlan's bracelet as a bait and \ncornered him in.  The key to \ncapturing is to block \nall possible escape routes. \nIf there is even a small {clear}escape route they will not \nenter the cage.{clear}Our plan is to use this cage \nto get rid of them as fast \nas we can. The Raptors who \neat them for snacks have \nstarted to roam around this \narea.

    <Text>I knew it would all come to \nthis.

The children hurt by \nthe dinosaurs have been put \ninside life-support chambers. \nI trust that the people of the \n{0x0008}past{0x0009} will take care of them. \nThe life-support chambers are \nalmighty.

However, \nthe chambers were originally \ndesigned for the growth of \ndinosaurs. Thus the \nknowledge fed will be limited \nto the knowledge of \ncoexisting with the dinosaurs.{clear}The tradegy is that the \nchildren will eventually lose \ntheir speaking ability.  But \ninstead they will have been \ninputted the instincts to \nprotect the dinosaurs. {clear}Today I have recorded my \nmessage for the man who \nwill definitely come here. \nWith this I have nothing \nto regret.</Text>

    <Text>June 2nd, 10:30PM \nTomorrow afternoon two \nmechanics are coming to this \nfacility from Edward City. \nIt is time for the annual \nmaintenance check of \nthe 3rd Energy Reactor. \nThis will be the 9th time.{clear}The instant something \nhappens to the underwater \nreactor, that is when all \nlife-lines will be cut off \nto us.  Again, all we can do \nis to pray that nothing \nwill happen.  As weird as it \nmay sound, sometimes I feel \nthat it'll do us all a favor \nif that reactor just {clear}blew up on us .{clear}June 3rd,  4:00PM \nThe mechanics who went to \nthe underwater 3rd Energy \nReactor still have not \nreturned.  They probably \nbecame their lunch.  This is \na problem.  One of the \nmechanics, Bob, has the key \nto the entrance of \nEdward City.{clear}To go from this facility to \nthe city, it is critical that \nwe get back the key. \nI guess there is no real \nchoice but to get in the \ndiving suit and go down \nmyself.  I just hope I don't \nbecome their dinner.</Text>
    <Text>Mechanic's Note</Text>
    <Text>To Bob, \nI heard that you were placed \nin charge of this area. \nAs a present for your new \nposition, here is a memo \nwhich may come in handy. \nIt's about restarting the \npower.{clear}When you try to initialize the \npower restarting program, it \noften stops right?  Well it's \ndue to the malfunctioning of \nthe three control terminals. \nHere are some tips to \noperate it.{clear}When you initialize the \nprogram, it quickly overloads \nand the lamp turns red, right? \nWell, when that happens all \nyou need to do is just give \nit some electric shock with \nsome kind of tool. \nIt should wake the sucker up. \nAnyway good luck.  See ya. \n                       Mike</Text>
    <Text>Preventative Maintenance</Text>
    <Text>As always, we'll conduct the \npreventative maintenance by \nassigning labor tasks. \nBob will be in charge of \nthe 3rd Energy Reactor \nitself. Alec will be in \ncharge of checking the \nWater Circulation System.{clear}As in previous years for the \nsafety of the mechanics, \nduring maintenance work \nmake sure to close the \nshutters for the cooling \naqueducts.  Alec will unplug \nthe plug which allows \ncontrol of the shutter and \nkeep it until Bob is done \nchecking the reactor.{clear}The other day there was an \nexplosion in the water \ncirculation chamber. \nThis explosion caused a crack \nin one of the concrete \ncolumns.  One more explosion \nwould have probably \ndestroyed it.  Remember to \nrepair that as well.</Text>

Their mobilty is \nextraordinary.{clear}Combat Notes \nThe first thing to do is \nstopping them. \nShooting NEEDLES is one way. \nBut the most effective way \nis to blast them with the \nSHOCKWAVE and knock them \nout. {clear}SHOCKWAVING them is \nespecially useful when there \nare multiple enemies.{clear}They like to hide in small \nplaces. \nSo you should be cautious \nnear walls where there are \nholes and openings.</Text>

There have \nbeen no sightings.{clear}However, last summer deep \nin the jungle, a dead T-Rex \nwas found with huge teeth \nmarks on its throat. \nThe rumor was not going to \nend just as a rumor. \nNot for a while. {clear}Combat Notes \nThere is nothing known \nabout their attacking \nbehaviors. \nThis can mean two things. \nOne is that no such dinosaur \nexists.  Two is that every \nsoldier who did encounter it \nhave disappeared without a \ntrace.{clear}Soldiers who strayed away \nfrom the troop, approximately \n70% of their bodies have not \nbeen found. \nJudging from this, we cannot \ningnore the fact that there \njust may be a gigantic \ndinosaur who have swallowed \nour men whole. {clear}Anyone who has seen the \ngiant never lives to tell about \nit.</Text>

Two years ago, \nthe volcano suddenly started \nacting up.  From about that \nsame time the four-legged \ncreature began appearing. \nThey seem to favor hot \nand dark places.{clear}We believed that these \nfour-legged creatures were \nherbivores due to the \nscarcity of living organisms \nin their habitat. \nBut when one our men was \nattacked by one of them, \nwe learned that they were \nactually omnivores. {clear}Although they are slow, \nwe have to find ways to \ncounter them.{clear}Combat Record \nWe still have yet to find \na way to fight them. \nIt's their ultra-hard armor \nwhich they wear that makes \nthem so tough.  No regular \nfirearm will hurt them.  Their \njaws are also very strong. \nStrong enough to even crush \na helmet.{clear}The only effective way we \nknow so far is, when they \nattack they stand on their \nhind legs. \nThis is when you should \nshoot their stomach. \nIt seems to be their \nweakpoint. {clear}Currently a prototype weapon \nis in the late stages of \ndevelopment. \nThis mine like weapon when \ncomplete should flip them on \ntheir backs.  But we don't \nknow for sure if it will \nreally work.</Text>

They are tiny \ndinosaurs.  They are typically \nno threat to humans. \nThey move in packs and their \nsocial life revolves around \ntheir pack.{clear}It's when they started \nnesting in our research \nfacility, is when they became \na nuisance. \n\nTheir eyes appears to be \nsimilar to that of the birds. {clear}We speculate that \nwhen they detect small shiny \nmetallic things, it is their \nbehavior to take it back to \ntheir nest. \nThis behavior has frquently \ncaused problems inside \nour facility.{clear}Combat Notes \nNo real notes has been taken \nsince they do not directly \ninflict harm to humans. \nHowever, we are thinking of \nways to stop them from \nstealing small belongings \nfrom the soldiers.</Text>
